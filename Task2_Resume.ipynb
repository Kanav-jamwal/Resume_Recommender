This  resulted  in  incorrect  GST  records  and  reporting.    This  issue  was \\nhighlighted  to  management  and  I  took  the  lead  to  rectify  the  issue  together  with  the  assistance  of GST \\nsoftware  consultant.

My role is an operation supervisor of the \\n\\nteam. We are working on client basis instead of product basis and thanks to this arrangement; I have a lot of exposure in tackling \\n\\ndifferent kind of financial products such as Equity, FX, Swaps, Fixed Income and the related Derivatives. Being accurate and precise \\n\\ncomes extremely important as we are providing professional services to hedge fund clients who are relatively demanding on the \\n\\nquality. Also, I’m trained to work under pressure in order to meet client’s needs. \\n\\n \\n\\nBefore taking my current role, I was working in the Capital Market Operation Department of Credit Agricole Corporate and \\n\\nInvestment Bank (CA-CIB) as the team leader of the out-of-hour support team, supporting our Headquarter (Paris branch) & London \\n\\nbranch. Duty of my team includes all the general back-office duties, including but not limited to Trade Confirmations and Settlements \\n\\n(Net / Gross), Payment drafting and processing, CLS position monitoring, I/O Swap trades booking and settlements. Also, we \\n\\nsupport our Americas Sales/Traders/Clients by taking care their enquiry and special requests. My role as a team leader is mainly \\n\\nverifying my teammate’s work to make sure everything has been taken care correctly and a smooth settlement without any delay on \\n\\npayments, leading the team when issue happen to minimize any potential lost, suggesting improvement on procedures in order to \\n\\nenhance team’s working efficiency. \\n\\n \\n\\nI work from 12am to 9am every night, I am responsible, passionate about working, willing to work overtime, and not afraid of working \\n\\nlaboriously. Besides, because of the nature of my team’s structure, I am experienced in working with colleagues who come from \\n\\ndifferent locations, India, France, USA, and South America. My working abilities & attitudes are also recognized by the management \\n\\n& Front Office; I have broken the record of my department by getting promotion from trainee, analyst to associate in just 2 years \\n\\ntogether with special bonus recognizing my contributions to the company. And on top of that, I am entitled with a special bonus in the \\n\\nmid-year which is limited to 10 employees only among the global CA-CIB group and I am 1 of the 10 \\n\\n \\n\\nApart from working experience, I have also a fruitful personal development and willing to take any new challenges. I had been \\n\\nbackpacking to more than 13 countries in Eastern Europe & Asia on my own for more than two months. Starting from Czech \\n\\nRepublic, I had passed the border between Europe & Asia by Trans-Siberian Railway, making use of land transport all the way back \\n\\nto Hong Kong instead of taking planes. This journey has really strengthened my personal abilities in tacking problems on my own, \\n\\ncommunicating with other people and being sincere to people I have met. Also, it has shown that I never be afraid of working \\n\\nlaboriously or independently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPlease kindly offer me the opportunity. By giving me a place to stand and I shall move the world \\n\\nThank you very much \\n\\n\\x0c',\n",

In  6 months’  time,  I was  given  the  opportunity  to \\n\\n\\x0clead  an  audit  team  of  6  (including  AVPs  and  VPs)  as  auditor-in-charge  for  an  overseas  branch  of \\napproximately  450  employees.  From  audit  planning  to  audit  execution,  I  coordinated  and  communicated \\naudit  request  with  my  counterparts  amicably.  I  applied  my  analytical  skill  to  analyse  and  summarise \\nvoluminous  financial  and  non-financial  data  into  a  4-page  audit  planning  memorandum.  I  also  exercised \\nprofessional  judgment with supporting data to determine the scope of the audit which I presented it to  the \\nregional  head  of  Asia  Pacific  directly  for  approval.  I managed  the  audit  execution  and  communicated with \\nbranch’s senior management daily to manage the expectation during the onsite audit. The audit identified a \\nnumber  of  areas  of  improvement  and  the  branch’s  senior management was  very  appreciative  of  the  value \\nadding recommendation as a result of the audit.  \\n \\nAfter the success of my first audit as an auditor-in-charge, I was given another opportunity to lead an audit \\nof  a wider  scope with  a  team  of  7  (including  AVPs  and  VPs).  I  received  positive  feedbacks  for  the  audits  I \\nled.  Besides,  I  obtained  a  new  qualification  in  2016  as  a  Certified  Anti-Money  Laundering  Specialist  to \\nfurther enhance my knowledge and hone my skill especially in the area of AML/CTF. \\n \\nAreas  of  audit  covered:  Front  office  (corporate  banking  departments,  wealth  management  department, \\ncash  management  service  –  electronic  banking),  back  office  operations  (deposits,  remittances,  cash \\nbanking,  trade  finance,  customer  instructions  such  as  opening,  closing  account  and  reactivating  dormant \\naccount),  legal  and  compliance,  AML  audit
